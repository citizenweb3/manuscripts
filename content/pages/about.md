## OUR MISSION ##

At Citizen Cosmos, we believe in the power of decentralized communities and the potential of blockchains to build a better world. We understand that blockchains are not just digital technologies, but they are similar to natural hives, forests, and patterns in the environment that allow us to communicate better. We value communication, honesty, and decentralization. We believe that open and verifiable blockchains should be viewed as digital nations and that our role is to help build and bring value to these nations.

Our unique value proposition is that we are an ecosystem developer in the web3 universe, working directly with citizens or token holders in decentralized and censorship-free blockchain networks. We do not represent the voice of the people like a mayor, but we are part of the community's voice. Our cities are decentralized, censorship-free, open and verifiable blockchain networks. We provide a variety of tools such as a web3-focused podcast, educational content, hackathons, distributed validator infrastructure, and an offline network that allows us to help dev teams form strategic partnerships. We also work with offline projects such as local artists, galleries, and permaculture communities, educating them about crypto and sometimes investing in them by donating crypto.

Our mission is to become the layer-0, a community bridge between ecosystems. We strive to run more nodes, create more content, form more partnerships, and validate more networks. We believe that by promoting communication, objective content, and education, we can create more efficient consensus and help to build a better world.

For now, Citizen Cosmos is primarily focused on Tendermint, Cosmos-SDK and Ethereum, but not only. We are a citizen of the interchain, and we validate Cosmos-based networks. We cover events as a media outlet, organize and sponsor events, create educational content and help people to dive into the rabbit hole. We also work with offline projects such as local artists, galleries, and permaculture communities, educating them about crypto and sometimes donating crypto to these projects.

By delegating tokens to [our validators](https://www.citizencosmos.space/staking), citizens can help us to keep going and contribute to the growth of the ecosystem. We strive to meet our values and believe that if a city can be prosperous and meet our values, we start to work around it. Our goal is not to be the best or unique team, but to work together with the community to build a better world.

May the code be with you!

## OUR TOOLS ##

1) We operate validators on the Cosmos Hub, Cyber / Bostrom, Omnflix, Neutron, Bitcanna, LikeCoin and Evmos networks. Check for more information [here](https://www.citizencosmos.space/staking), where you will find help on how to stake on these networks.

2) We have an NFT collection dedicated to our podcast episodes, slowly creating one of the coolest DAOs in the space. Check it [here](https://www.citizencosmos.space/nft).

3) We're content creators too. We share information and experiences through blog articles and guides on a range of topics. Whether you're looking for advice, inspiration, or just some good reading material, our content has got you covered. Check our blog [here](https://citizen-cosmos.github.io/manuscripts/).

4) We produce podcasts, odysseys, debates and create educational content. You can check all our podcast episodes here and our live streams on our [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCP0ZV8ducS3U2QEsIZQ1taQ).

## OUR MANIFESTO ##

> From this distant vantage point, the Earth might not seem of any particular interest. But for us, it's different. Consider again at that dot. That's here. That's home. That's us. On it everyone you love, everyone you know, everyone you ever heard of, every human being who ever was, lived out their lives. The aggregate of our joy and suffering, thousands of confident religions, ideologies, and economic doctrines, every hunter and forager, every hero and coward, every creator and destroyer of civilization, every king and peasant, every young couple in love, every mother and father, hopeful child, inventor and explorer, every teacher of morals, every corrupt politician, every "superstar," every "supreme leader," every saint and sinner in the history of our species lived there--on a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam... Our posturings, our imagined self-importance, the delusion that we have some privileged position in the Universe, are challenged by this point of pale light. Our planet is a lonely speck in the great enveloping cosmic dark. In our obscurity, in all this vastness, there is no hint that help will come from elsewhere to save us from ourselves...

*From 'A Pale Blue Dot', by Carl Sagan.*

We believe in freedom above needs. We believe in possibilities above enforcement. We believe in values above desires. We believe that censorship has killed more people than anything else together combined. We value honesty and we value the truth. We value love and cherish all existing creatures. We value intelligence and we value decentralization.

We believe in communication, which allows participants to think, make their mind up and cast personal votes on any topic and subject. We think that content should strive to lack subjective opinions and help its consumers to form an opinion, which will result in better discussion, and in turn in a more efficient consensus.

We believe that blockchains are not simply a form of digital nations. But, open and verifiable blockchains are somewhat similar to natural hives, forests, patterns in the nature that allow us to communicate better. Without communication, we are doomed, and decentralized consensus is a tool that can and will help those who desire to make our pale blue dot a slightly better place.
