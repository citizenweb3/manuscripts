## OUR MISSION ##

At Citizen Cosmos, we believe in the power of decentralized communities and the potential of blockchains to build a better world. We understand that blockchains are not just digital technologies, but they are similar to natural hives, forests, and patterns in the environment that allow us to communicate better. We value communication, honesty, and decentralization. We believe that open and verifiable blockchains should be viewed as digital nations and that our role is to help build and bring value to these nations.

Our unique value proposition is that we are an ecosystem developer in the web3 universe, working directly with citizens or token holders in decentralized and censorship-free blockchain networks. We do not represent the voice of the people like a mayor, but we are part of the community's voice. Our cities are decentralized, censorship-free, open and verifiable blockchain networks. We provide a variety of tools such as a web3-focused podcast, educational content, hackathons, distributed validator infrastructure, and an offline network that allows us to help dev teams form strategic partnerships. We also work with offline projects such as local artists, galleries, and permaculture communities, educating them about crypto and sometimes investing in them by donating crypto.

Our mission is to become the layer-0, a community bridge between ecosystems. We strive to run more nodes, create more content, form more partnerships, and validate more networks. We believe that by promoting communication, objective content, and education, we can create more efficient consensus and help to build a better world.

For now, Citizen Cosmos is primarily focused on Tendermint, Cosmos-SDK and Ethereum, but not only. We are a citizen of the interchain, and we validate Cosmos-based networks. We cover events as a media outlet, organize and sponsor events, create educational content and help people to dive into the rabbit hole. We also work with offline projects such as local artists, galleries, and permaculture communities, educating them about crypto and sometimes donating crypto to these projects.

By delegating tokens to our validators, citizens can help us to keep going and contribute to the growth of the ecosystem. We strive to meet our values and believe that if a city can be prosperous and meet our values, we start to work around it. Our goal is not to be the best or unique team, but to work together with the community to build a better world.

May the code be with you!
