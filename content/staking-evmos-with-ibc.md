Sometimes you need to send your tokens from one chain to another using Keplr. But many people really struggle with this. We made this guide for newbies to show how you can do this. We will show it on Osmosis to Evmos transfer. So, let’s go. 

First, you need to turn Advanced IBC transfers on

Then, you need to copy your Evmos address

Then, you need to add New IBC Transfer Channel

And add EVMOS channel

Now, after you sent your tokens from Osmosis to Evmos you can stake them.

Click stake

You find a validator and click Manage

You enter the amount you want to delegate, and click Delegate. As a good practice you should leave some tokens for future fees

Then, you need to approve the transaction with Keplr

That’s it. You have transferred tokens from Osmosis to Evmos and staked them.
