<p>On July 18th, the ecosystem dwellers witnessed the start of the <a href="https://momentumhack.evmos.org/">Evmos Momentum Hackathon</a> that will last till August 31st. It is the first Evmos event with this number of participants, prize budget, and partners. Web3Scholarship is leading the hackathon to build the Evmos Ecosystem. We at Citizen Cosmos, being Evmos validators, naturally follow each step of the hackathon and decided to share helpful information with you!</p>
<p>The purpose of the Hackathon is to seed and support the development of the Evmos ecosystem. The total prize pool is $500,000, split between the grand prize, track prizes, and EVM migration awards. Additional funding opportunities are available from Huobi Incubators and partners. </p>
<p>The Hackathon includes five prize categories:</p>
<p>Infrastructure. The prize subject for this category can be anything that contributes to developing tools and frameworks for cross-compatibility chains and provides a base and supports for applications to evolve. The winner will have to show the world which way the ecosystem should go!</p>
<p>DeFi. In this category, the participant should try and answer: What if a smart contract can eliminate loopholes and attacks by removing security vulnerabilities from its design? What has been introduced to the financial world that can leverage the Evmos blockchain? How can we put tokens and NFTs into the world of open, transparent, and decentralized transaction platforms? The desired winning project is a financial vehicle or service that is asynchronous and capable of expanding the reach of decentralized finance. </p>
<p>Metaverse, NFT &amp; GameFi. The submission must incorporate a system or code framework that can lead to or support the construction of a metaverse. It can be the base of a metaverse or a story in the form of NFT, GameFi, etc. The metaverse should obtain a purpose and be expandable!</p>
<p>Web 3. This category aims for decentralized projects like DAO or SocialFi, which incorporate a form of split ownership within the community. </p>
<p>For the categories mentioned above, the prizes are as follows:
1st Prize — $50,000 + Demo Day Opportunity + Funding Opportunity
2nd Prize — $30,000 + Demo Day Opportunity + Funding Opportunity
3rd Prize — $20,000 + Demo Day Opportunity + Funding Opportunity</p>
<p>EVM Migration Award. This prize category is for the projects that will take the initiative to bring solid solutions to the Evmos ecosystem. The two winning projects will gain $10,000 each. </p>
<p>There is also the Grand Champion award for the submission, which the judging panel will deem to be the strongest of all submissions. The project should solve a real problem in the Evmos ecosystem, and the solution should be able to be utilized in a short amount of time and scaled up. The award recipient will receive $80,000! 
The Momentum Hackathon also includes a series of educational workshops on building and launching projects on Evmos. Moreover, each week there is AMA for Q&amp;A sessions. 
The team of judges for the contest is also pretty impressive! Among the jury members of the Hackathon are Praneeth Srikanti, the investment partner of Ethereal Ventures; Rain&amp;Coffee, the research analyst from Maven11 Capital; Jim Parillo, the general partner of Figment Capital; Liam, the business development manager from Evmos, and many more! </p>
<p>We highly encourage you to follow the Evmos Momentum Hackathon because it’s a grand event for both Evmos and the entire ecosystem that will contribute to the significant and ongoing process of building the decentralized community! </p>
