<p>Citizen Cosmos:<br />
After I already realized that it goes live, but this is going to happen. And I think we are already live. Let me just check that it's all working. Let me just see our beautiful faces. There we go. There's our beautiful faces. So hi everybody. It's citizen cosmos with our Odyssey and Isaac today. Hi Isaac. Sorry to interrupt your hello there.</p>
<p>Isaac Zarb:<br />
Hello, how are you?</p>
<p>Citizen Cosmos:<br />
Good, good, Isaac. So yeah, for everyone who is watching this stream or recording, as you probably usually would with us. This is of course, exploring validators. And today we have Simply Staking and Isaac is the co founder and the CTO of Simply Staking. And let's do like a traditional typical thing, you know, before we go off into our questions, Isaac, I would like to ask yourself what is Simply Staking for you personally in your own words and why on earth did you one day woke up and decide to be part of this business or endeavor or adventure or whatever. So what is Simply Staking and how did you get here? That is the first question.</p>
<p>Isaac Zarb:<br />
To me, it's a lot of stress and lack of sleep, I would say. And I guess...</p>

<p>Episode name:<br />
Bridging Digital Nations: A Discussion on the Corruption of Centralized Bridges, Academia vs field work &amp; The Importance of Community in Decentralization with Alexei Zamyatin.</p>
<p>In this episode, Alexei Zamyatin Co-Founder of Interlay is interviewed. He discusses merge mining, the first cross chain protocol and how it contributed to domain squatting. Alexei gives his thoughts on the dangers of projects using their own token as collateral, the future of trustless bridges and the power of academia.  There is also interesting discussion regarding the innate corruption of man over time and how trust in software increases with use over time.</p>

<p>Citizen Cosmos<br />
Hi everybody, welcome to a new episode of the Citizen Cosmos Podcast. And again, I love doing those intros and I love messing them up. But nevertheless, I have with me today Alexei. Alexei is the CEO and founder of Interlay. We will find out from him about Interlay and about himself in a second. But Alexei, hi, welcome to the show.</p>
<p>Alexei<br />
Hi, thanks for having me.</p>
<p>Citizen Cosmos<br />
I'm very glad to be having you. We are slowly, in Citizen Cosmos, have been trying to interview people outside of just Cosmos ecosystem. And in my opinion, you happen to be such kind of a person who's not just focused on the Cosmos ecosystem, but focused on the whole of Interchain. And this has been our object and goal all along. So first, I mean, I already said CEO and founder of Interlay, but please, if you could make your own intro with you know, whatever you are working on, whatever you fancy telling about yourself, please.</p>
