<p><strong>The transition from centralization to decentralization</strong></p>
<p>Until recently, our world was primarily centralized. The priority form of government was, in most cases, a pyramidal structure. Decisions and orders descend from top to bottom. From bosses to subordinates, from corporate managers to branch directors, from the central bank to banks, from the president to ministers, and on to the people. And although it is believed that democracy prevails in society, and all decisions are made based on a social contract, we all see perfectly well that critical decisions are made in a single center of concentration of power.</p>
<p><strong>However, blockchain has changed everything...</strong></p>
<p>Everything changed with the invention of blockchain technology (although some conspiracy theorists believe that this technology was given to us from above =)). Blockchain gradually entered our lives and changed our paradigm of thinking from centralized representations to decentralized ones. Blockchain has shown that it is possible to negotiate, make decisions and monitor their implementation without involving a single center of power. In the blockchain, all processes and management are open and belong directly to the community without intermediaries. Therefore, it is quite attractive, which is why the number of decentralized services proliferates.</p>
<p><strong>Decentralization in the wild</strong></p>
<p>A decentralized service is a distributed organism where each user is a part of one whole. As an example consider the forest as an example of a decentralized system of blockchains and interchains.</p>
<p>The tree blockchain interacts with the grass blockchain and the squirrel blockchain. Many decentralized ecosystems in the forest are interconnected by bridges and send transactions to each other. The kingdom of mushrooms alone is worth something.</p>
<p>The forest does not have a single control center. Instead, each part of it acts in its interests. Yet, all its elements are combined into a giant ecosystem and are naturally synchronized with each other.</p>
<p><strong>The idea</strong></p>
<p>In the same way, a group of people united by a common idea or having the same values ​​can join a community where there will be no chairperson, deputy, secretary, etc. The meaning in these positions disappears, and corruption opportunities are associated with them. Such communities can interact with other groups and communities as well as individuals. And the rules of these interactions and communications are equal. A smart contract monitors the fulfillment of the conditions of exchange and transactions. Regulators, notaries, and brokers are no longer needed. They are extra in this chain of interaction.</p>
<p>The idea of ​​decentralization is increasingly capturing the minds of people. The absence of a central governing body is so attractive that the number of new blockchains has recently been overgrowing. And the number of services built on these blockchains is growing even faster. Already today, we see such services as decentralized exchanges, decentralized finance and loans, decentralized data storage services, decentralized video hosting (https://bastyon.org), instant messengers (https://usedust.com), and even social networks (http://twister.net.co). And in the future, entire states based on the blockchain may appear.</p>
<p>Which decentralized services are you lacking?</p>

<p>The hype around NFT is already subsiding, and sales of NFT images have come to naught. But is the technology of non-fungible tokens as useless as they say lately?</p>
<p>The most familiar tokens to us are subway cards. We buy a subway token to ride the subway. If earlier only states and large corporations could issue their tokens, now everyone can issue them within 15 minutes.</p>
<p>There are a lot of different tokens. Management tokens, tokens for purchasing services and goods, music, works of art, and tokens for buying services and goods. In China, reputation is tokenized in the form of a social rating). Soon, all citizens will be tokenized with the introduction of state digital money (CBDC).</p>
<p><strong>All tokens can be divided into fungible and non-fungible, better known as NFTs.</strong></p>
<p>Fungible tokens are issued for identical goods or services that do not differ from each other. For example, there is a certain amount of tokens for taking the subway, and it makes no difference which token you use for this trip.</p>
<p>Another thing is non-fungible NFT tokens. They are usually released for something unique. It is generally viewed that NFTs are pixelated pictures people buy for crazy money. In fact, they are not. For example, we have a cottage village of 10 buildings. All houses were built using the same materials and a standard layout. But one home is located at the entrance to the town, and the other on the outskirts. One house faces the forest, and the other one the lake. In this case, for each house, it will be necessary to issue a separate non-fungible NFT token.</p>
<p>The most exciting thing is that you can measure a person's reputation with the help of the NFT token. The reputation tokenization is inextricably linked with personality tokenization.</p>
<p><strong>How does it work?</strong></p>
<p>For example, Rachel decided to become a programmer. For now she is not a programmer yet and needs funds for subsistence and training. Rachel can issue <strong>10,000</strong> tokens for her programs. At the presale, Rachel can sell her tokens for <strong>$10-$20</strong>. But after some time, when Rachel becomes a high-class programmer, her services will increase in price and be estimated at <strong>$100-200</strong>, depending on how well she masters programming languages.</p>
<p>If Rachel fulfills the obligations on the tokens, her reputation will grow. And in case of failure to fulfill the obligations, it will accumulate a vast negative reputation. This will make it clear to others whether to have business with Rachel or not.</p>
<p>NFTs are tightly integrated into our lives, and most likely, the world around us will soon be tokenized. Driver's licenses, real estate rights, art, and even pets.</p>
