Did it did. Can't. Hey, Andrew. Hey, man. Can you hear me? Okay, great. So we have sound. That's good. And lets approved Dan as well. Dan Can you hear me too? Say something. I'm good, Dan. Okay, great. So let's give it, like, some chit chat to the know, because it's going to take some time until people join. Let's hope that we have live ... some people.</p>

Good Space time yall and welcome to a new episode of a Citizen Cosmos podcast. A source for educational insights into the world of Web3. In today's episode, we are speaking with Chad Barraford, the CTO of ThorChain. We delve into a wide range of Thought provoking topics, including the early applications of AI and their potential impact. Explore the concept of a ten hour work  week and discuss the shifting landscape of web3 lending, including the dangers of Defi designs.
We delve into the importance of separating money from the state and address the challenges surrounding scalability. During our discussion. We also touch upon the role of crypto in advancing human rights and the significance of ethical development practices and the need for the crypto community to continuously explore new possibilities.</p>
