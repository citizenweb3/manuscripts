<p>Citizen Cosmos<br />
Good Space time yall. In this episode of The Citizen Cosmos podcast, I talk with Jae Kwon, founder of Cosmos and the author of the Tendermint Whitepaper. Along with Jae, we talk about censorship resistant systems, truth in instincts, misleading narratives and division in the society. We also discuss humanity, the importance of discourse, fiction, semantics, the power of history and languages and smart contract systems</p>
<p>Jae Kwon<br />
We have to create alternative financial systems because the system we're living under seems captured. It feels more like the wormhole between our physical world and the completely different kind of world. What makes a smart contract system good is going to be the language itself. It's really an ongoing battle of getting the truth out so that the things that were hidden become known and compellingly known in a way that is digestible to people so that they can say, Oh, that's crazy. That's actually a real.</p>

<p>Episode name:<br />
Jaya Klara Brekke, Trust, Privacy &amp; Drone Strikes.</p>
<p>In this episode, Citizen Cosmos talks to Jaya Klara Brekke, head of strategy at Nym. They discuss the nature of man and if we can overcome our innate greed and embrace the more altruistic aspects of human nature to build a better tomorrow. Jaya discusses privacy and decentralisation and how she distinguishes between the different iterations of each. Jaya also gives a lot of detail regarding Nym and Nyx. And as always, Citizen Cosmos plays the devil’s advocate at key times.</p>

<p>Citizen Cosmos<br />
Good space time yall In this episode of The Citizen Cosmos podcast, I speak to Jaya Klara Brekke, Chief Strategy Officer at NYM Project Privacy Platform, working on infrastructure at the network and application layers. Along with Jaya, we discuss decentralization and its origins, trust networking. Privacy is a fundamental right and who needs saving. We also talked about some anticorruption, criminal activity, pain as a catalyst for change and drone strikes.</p>
<p>Jaya<br />
Was super curious about the totally crazy mix of people that was in this hall. It was everything from dreadlocked anarchists to people in the financial sector all the way through to kind of devs and hackers.</p>
