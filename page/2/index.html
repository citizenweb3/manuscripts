Welcome everyone to a new episode of the Citizen Cosmos Podcasstas. Sometimes I forget what I'm doing where I am, but we are here. the Citizen Cosmos podcast Willy hi. Welcome to the show again. Welcome back to the show. Shall I say?</p>
<p>willy:<br />
GM Serj, happy to be back. Thanks for inviting me.</p>
<p>citizen_cosmos:<br />
Yea, So just for the listeners out there, we have willy with us from shape shift. Well, I don't know if I should introduce it like that any more. Shall I, shall I still say shape shift, or shall I now use the name of the upcoming chain? Or what shall I do? Man? How shall I introduce you?</p>
<p>willy:<br />
It's a good question. I'm a community member of shapeshift. I'm a community member of Arcio. Technically, I'm the head of decentralization for the Fox Foundation. But a lot of people aren't familiar with the Fox Foundation. So shapeshift is probably the most recognized brand. And Arcio</p>
