<p>Episode name:<br />
Jonathan Caras, NFT's, money &amp; stablecoins.</p>
<p>In this episode, Citizen Cosmos talks to Jonathan Caras, dragon rider, proffessional magician and computer science prodigy. In this episode they cover a range of topics, including dragons on Mars, the Hostory of the Sheckle and the collapse of  empires. Jonothan has some insights into stablecoins and why it is essential we wrest control of currency away from government. 
They also explore what could be the catalyst for broader user adoption and give some great reasons to buy NFT's.</p>

Good space-time, y'all. In this episode of The Citizen Cosmos podcast, I speak with Jonathan Caras, currently working on Levana, collateralized trading platform. We discuss inflation, stablecoins, NFT’s in gaming, collapse of empires and the history of the Shekel. We also talk about dragons on Mars, the life cycle of living organisms and trust in money.</p>
<p>Jonathan<br />
I’ve worked for a company that built a fashion app called Screenshop for the Kardashians.
It’s verifiable, you can store it in your head, it’s not sizeable by the government, it allows for arbitrage of electricity, it crosses borders.
Do thought of it, like a year before me.</p>

<p>Episode name:<br />
Carter Woetzel, privacy, trust &amp; silk.</p>
<p>In this episode, Citizen Cosmos speaks to Carter Woetzel, co-founder of Shade Protocol, built on the Secret Network.
Carter delves into his book, Building Confidence in Blockchain, what inspired him to write it and why he feels we should read it.
They discuss the concept of trust in Blockchain and how we can solve the trust dilemma.
Citizen Cosmos and Carter debate whether regulators are actually needed and whether what they actually do that is worthwhile. 
Carter discusses some of the projects being built on Shade Protocol, like Silk, a privacy protecting stable coin for Cosmos. As always, Citizen Cosmos ends off with the Blitz and gets Carter to speak to his motivations and projects that he has great respect for.</p>
<hr />
<p>Citizen Cosmos<br />
Good space-time, y'all. In this episode of The Citizen Cosmos podcast, I speak with Carter Woetzel, the chief researcher of Shade Protocol, a privacy focused Defi project built with Cosmos SDK on top of the Secret network. Along with Carter, we discuss privacy on blockchains and smart contracts, Homomorphic encryption, auditability, and trust. We also talked about simplifying gas, non-traditional stablecoins, futuristic tokens and our perception of time in blockchains.</p>
<p>Carter<br />
Crypto’s at the crossroads of all those things. So many times, in this space we lose track of why the technology is valuable. And so why is decentralization so important? What is the problem that blockchain is ultimately solving?</p>
