<p>Episode name:<br />
Benjamin, Adoption, Censorship resistance &amp; Composability.</p>
<p>In this #citizencosmos podcast episode, Benjamin, co-founder of ArweaveNews, permacastapp, and <a href="https://www.decent.land/">decent.land</a>, discusses various web 3 and decentralization topics. They talk about creating web 3 social media with current tools and debate the readiness of web 3 for everyone. The conversation also covers decentralized identities, merging account identities, friction in using web 3 tools, and the possibility of decentralizing everything and everyone. They further debate how to incentivize users to move to web 3 and why users should use Areweave instead of IPFS.</p>

<p>Citizen Cosmos<br />
Good space time yall in this episode of The Citizen Cosmos podcast, I'm joined by Benjamin, a.k.a. xylophonezy. He's the founder of Decent Land a Tool for Building Decentralized Communities Arweave news and Permacast podcast Storage Protocol. Along with Benjamin, we discussed storage development Dao tooling, decentralized frontend, the state of web2 and web3, and the adoption of the latter. We also spoke about interoperability and whether or not decentralization should be the end goal of everything.</p>
<p>Benjamin<br />
I kind of felt uncomfortable about the fact that we were like all about decentralization, price is almost like a crutch for, you know, a project that might just be an EVM fork that can't offer anything else. Having your DAO discussions on Web2 puts the transparency at risk. The incentives in Web2 are anti-user Social media is pretty much controlled by five or so companies, all of which use closed source non interoperable protocols.</p>

<p>Episode name:<br />
Denis Fadeev, Cosmos, Tribalism &amp; Motivation.</p>
<p>In this episode of Citizen Cosmos podcast, the host interviews Denis Fadeev, developer of Ignite. They discuss the importance of valuing developer’s time, providing users with a feedback loop, and the necessity of tutorials and documentation in building a blockchain. Fadeev shares his passion for building for developers and the role of the CosmosHub in the ecosystem. They address the issue of tribalism in crypto and how Cosmos is working to fix it. The conversation then shifts to Ignite, a marketplace of sovereign blockchains, and how it helps projects build. They highlight the motivation to keep on building and the flexibility of Cosmos that keeps it interesting.</p>

<p>Citizen Cosmos<br />
Good space time, y'all. In this episode of The Citizen Cosmos podcast, I speak to Denis Fadeev ex VP of product at Tendermint and creator of Ignite CLI. Along with Denis, we discussed time and value developers Users and feedback and the passion to build tools working remotely, and the steps in building blockchains. We also talk about the Cosmos Hub, tribalism, marketplaces and sovereign blockchains, motivation and flexibility.</p>
<p>Denis<br />
And this is the crucial thing, I think in the beginning you need to make the developer experience as smooth as possible. Building a blockchain is not everything you also need to build end user applications. If something doesn't work, you are free to create something that is better, that has functionality that he wants, and you don't have to ask anyone. The decisions made through governance actually change the course of events.</p>
